/*An STL is a library of generic functions and classes which saves you time and energy which you would have spent constructing for your use. This helps you reuse these well tested classes and functions umpteenth number of times according to your own convenience. 

To put this simply, STL is used because it is not a good idea to reinvent something which is already built and can be used to innovate things further. Suppose you go to a company who builds cars, they will not ask you to start from scratch, but to start from where it is left. This is the basic idea behind using STL.

Components of STL
1. Containers -> stores data, use templates classes
2. Algorithm -> sorting, searching, use templates functions
3. Iteratiors -> object points to an element in a container, handled just like pointers, connects agowithm with containers
